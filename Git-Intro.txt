->When number of people are working on particular file, if one person make any chnages that updated file must have by other people who working on that file.
->Each person have their own repository  where the poeple can do commit and update actions on working copy and push/pull their changes in Git Hub i.e server.
-> The main advatnage is we don't have on internet connect alwasys we can work on working file even on offline, but we need interner connetcion when we have to do push operation.

PC1 -> working file ->  (commit/update) -> Repository
                                                    => (Push//Pull) ->Repository (Server)
PC2 -> working file -> (commit/update) -> Repository
